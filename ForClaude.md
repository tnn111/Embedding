# Coding requests for Claude
## What is given

I have a collection of 7-mer distributions generated by the calculate_kmer_frequencies script. It is in a text file with ~2M lines. Each line has 8,192 entries separated by space. The entries are floating point numbers between 0 and 1 and they sum to 1.

## What I need

I would like you to produce a variational autoencoder (VAE) written in Python using the Keras library. The encoder portion should take as input the 8,192 7-mer frequencies and pass them through 3 successive linear layers. The first should have 2,048 nodes, the second should have 512 nodes and the third should have 128 nodes and that should be the dimension of the latent space. The decoder should reverse the process.

Name the file containing the VAE VAE.py.

## Implementation Details (Updated)

The following design decisions were made:
- **Activation functions**: ReLU for hidden layers
- **Output layer**: Softmax (ensures outputs sum to 1, treating as probability distribution)
- **Loss function**: Cross-entropy (reconstruction) + KL divergence (VAE regularization)
- **Data source**: ./Data/kmer_frequencies_l5000_shuffled.txt
- **Train/validation split**: 80/20
- **Training hyperparameters**: epochs=50, batch_size=256

✅ **Status**: VAE.py has been created with full training code.
