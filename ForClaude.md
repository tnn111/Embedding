## What is given

We have a set of contigs generated from long read metagenomic assemblies. The contigs are in the file Data/contigs.fna. They are in FASTA format.

## What I need

I would like a piece of Python code that turns my my FASTA file into a file where each line contains the defline ID followed by a tab and then followed by a space separated list of normalized 7-mer frequencies from the corresponding DNA sequence. The frequencies should correspond to to the canonical ones; i.e., there list of frequencies should only have 8,192 entries.

## Questions

Please ask me as many questions as you need to if there is doubt.
